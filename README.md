    cd sample-discordjs-bot
    ```

2. Rename [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env`

    ```env
    DISCORD_TOKEN= 
    # Your bot token

    GUILD_ID=
    # Only put an ID here if you want commands to be registered in one server.

    CLIENT_ID=
    # Your bot's application ID (can be found on Discord or on the Discord Developer Portal)
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Please check the [discord.js docs](https://discord.js.org), [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide), and [discord-api-types](https://discord-api-types.dev) for proper types, properties and method usage.
> 
> You will notice the current discord.js guide uses `@discordjs/builders` for command creation. This template uses raw objects for creating commands which makes use of enum types [ApplicationCommandType](https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/enum/ApplicationCommandType) and [ApplicationCommandOptionType](https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/enum/ApplicationCommandOptionType).
